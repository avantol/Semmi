# Semmi
Semmi is your assistant for WSJT-X (the extremely popular amateur radio weak-signal digital modes program).
<br>This (experimental) helper program has limited automation features, for those operators who prefer a manual approach to FT8, and also appreciate useful decision support.
<br><br>Click here > <b>https://github.com/avantol/Semmi/blob/main/Semmi.msi</b> (also above), then download <img src="https://github.com/avantol/Semmi/blob/main/dl.JPG"> and run <b>Semmi.msi</b> to install.
<br>At the Windows warning message, click "More info" then "Run anyway".
<br><br><i><b>Use all appropriate caution since transmit can start at any time once you select "Enable auto-reply"!!! Whenever the "Enable auto-reply" button is green, your antenna can be energized.</b></i>
<br><br>Semmi runs alongside your existing version of WSJT-X (must use Windows 10 or later for reliability).
<br><br>As a start, Semmi stores up "new" CQs (not worked before) that are interesting to you, and allows you to reply to each CQ, either manually or automatically:
<br><br><img src="https://github.com/avantol/Semmi/blob/main/Semmi.JPG">
<br><br>You can also do things like:
<br>- reply automatically to new CQs from local and/or DX stations
<br>- reply automatically to new CQs from POTA stations
<br>- reply automatically to new CQs directed to your state or country
<br>- reply automatically to new CQs for the current band and/or mode
<br>- reply automatically to CQs from new countries (and/or new for the current band)
<br>- reply automatically to CQs from any countries you worked but have not QSL'd yet
<br>- view all stored CQ details: country, continent, distance, SNR, and azimuth
<br>- have much more time to research callers on QRZ, PSKReporter, and LOTW...
<br><br>Note: Semmi is a bit fussy about the WSJT-X configuration, and will let you know what to watch out for.
<br>If it's all a bit too much for you, use "<a href="https://github.com/avantol/Otto">Otto</a>", which is much better integrated with (a modified) <a href="https://github.com/avantol/WSJT-X_2.7.0">WSJT-X</a>, and with many more helpful features.
