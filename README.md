# Semmi
 Semmi, the (experimental) WSJT-X helper with limited automation features, for those hams who prefer a manual approach to FT8, but with decision support.
 <br><br>As a start, Semmi stores up CQs that are interesting to you that come in while you're working another call, then allows you to reply to each CQ in turn, either manually or automatically.
<br><br>You can also do things like:
<br>- reply automatically to local or DX stations you haven't worked yet
<br>- reply automatically to CQs from POTA or SOTA stations
<br>- reply automatically to CQs directed to your state or country
<br>- reply automatically to multi-stream stations
<br>- view CQ details: distance, SNR, and azimuth
<br>- have much more time to research callers on QRZ, PSKReporter, and LOTW...
