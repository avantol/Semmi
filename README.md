# Semmi
 Semmi, the (experimental) WSJT-X helper with limited automation features, for those hams who prefer a partially manual approach to FT8, and who appreciate useful decision support information.
 <br><br><i><b>Use all appropriate caution since transmit can start at any time once you select "Enable auto-reply"!!! Whenever the "Enable auto-reply" button is green, your antenna can be energized.</b></i>
 <br><br>Semmi runs alongside your existing version of WSJT-X (must use Windows 10 or later for reliability).
 <br><br>As a start, Semmi stores up "new" CQs (not worked before) that are interesting to you, and allows you to reply to each CQ, either manually or automatically.

<br><br>You can also do things like:
<br>- reply automatically to new CQs from local and/or DX stations
<br>- reply automatically to new CQs from POTA stations
<br>- reply automatically to new CQs directed to your state or country
<br>- reply automatically to new CQs for the current band and/or mode
<br>- reply automatically to CQs from new countries (and/or new for the current band)
<br>- reply automatically to CQs from any countries you worked but have not QSL'd yet
<br>- view all stored CQ details: country, continent, distance, SNR, and azimuth
<br>- have much more time to research callers on QRZ, PSKReporter, and LOTW...
<br><br>Download and run Semmi.msi to install:
